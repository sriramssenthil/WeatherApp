## Live Weather App
This application uses the Weather API (https://www.weatherapi.com) to get the live weather statistics for any city inputted by the user. The information returned by the application (City, Region, Country, Temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius) is then stored into a database in order to track weather trends over time.
